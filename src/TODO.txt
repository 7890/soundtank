-- GOAL: To make instruments for the Oxygen8. It has 8 cc nobs, a
   slider, a mod wheel, a pitch wheel, and of course, 2 octaves of
   keys.


- in overwrite mode mute & unmute doesn't work

-- add event maps to namespace. => all event maps need a name. Tests &
   actions as well. ln command? or just use at. Controls & data ports
   as well. But namespaces must be kept in order. Each rtobject has
   ./controls ./ports ./maps, maps has ./tests ./actions. ???


- in set action, when specifying range for shifting, accept reverse
  order range as inversion. IE, upper bound followed by lower bound =>
  invert value range.

- multiple data port connections

- more map stuff, copying events to jump to many targets

- some thoughts: dummy controls, att control1 control2 updates map,
  changing map elements in place
  
- instances:  re-add owner-object index for debugging readout,
  readout of proc index when listing rtobjects?

- must fix fxn to generate array from command line using dynamic
  allocation

- all commands need standardization, to allow for tab-completion. Need
  a structure with: name, short description, help description, fxn,
  option autocompletion fxn

- auto completion of command names

- auto completion of command arguments

- make ogg file imp object

- standardize imp objects??? 

- when creating SRC rtobjects, check if they are really FILTER rtobjects
  and change major type accordingly.

- ls -qf : show only ladspa plugins with frequency controls

- make control rtobject : contains a description of the controls of a
  particular piece of hardware, used in creating auto attachments.

- ld file.xml -n (name as) name-of-created-rtobject, -f find rtobject
  in xml file, save append to file option

- use LADSPA run-adding functionality when available /*do enough
  plugins do this for it to be worthwhile?*/
